# Design principles
* Normalized schema (long tables, few fields)
* Files as central component
* Type and location agnostic
* Samples as a grouping mechanism, not as “sample definition”
* Tags and tag-value pairs to carry metadata for both samples and files
* Views for convenience

# Database core schema
